Hi there! 👋


I'm Mubarak, a future software engineer based in Northern Virginia. 


I love creating full-stack projects that align with the current themes of my life, tying them together with a mix of resources that help others!


I'm currently focused on AI, machine learning, and workflows.


I'm a spontaneous collaborator looking to learn, grow, innovate, and build every day!



Fun Facts:
I was born in Cairo, Egypt (yes, I am a pharaoh).
I have a collection of 50+ fragrances.
I've founded two businesses.
I'll never turn down the opportunity to strike up a random conversation.
