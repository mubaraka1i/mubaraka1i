Hi there! 👋🏼


I'm Mubarak, a software engineer based in Northern Virginia. 👨🏽‍💻


I love creating full-stack projects that align with the current themes of my life, tying them together with a mix of resources that help others!


I'm currently focused on AI, machine learning, and workflows.


I'm a spontaneous collaborator looking to learn, grow, innovate, and build every day! 📈




Fun Facts:

I was born in Cairo, Egypt (yes, I am a pharaoh). 🇪🇬

I have a collection of 50+ fragrances.

I've founded two businesses.

I'll never turn down the opportunity to strike up a random conversation. 🗣️
